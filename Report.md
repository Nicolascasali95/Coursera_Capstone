<h2><strong>Business problem</strong></h2>
<p>As a global trend, people are increasingly choosing to eat outside. It can be bars, restaurants, food trucks, etc. but the message es clear: more household income percentage is being used to outside food events. Furthermore, the concept of food itself is changing from a &ldquo;product&rdquo; to an &ldquo;experience&rdquo; perspective. Millennials want to share their experiences on social media, try new things, new flavours, new textures.</p>
<p>It is in this context that we can explain the rapid success of <strong>Fusi&oacute;n Internacional, </strong>a relatively new restaurant located in Cordoba, Argentina that has been experiencing rapid growth over the last couple of years. In fact, the owner is evaluating the possibility of opening a new venue. Apparently, the neighbourhood where the restaurant is located right now, seems to be the perfect catalyser for this rapid success, where plenty of millennials choose to hang out day and night.</p>
<p>After analysing the situation in detail, the owner decides to think big and go to the big city: <strong>Buenos Aires</strong>. Being the capital and largest city of&nbsp;Argentina, it is home of more than 2.8 million people, which is more than twice the population of Cordoba, and &nbsp;that is without considering the huge amount of people that work in Buenos Aries but have their residence outside the city.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires is the financial, industrial, and commercial hub of Argentina. The economy in the city proper alone, measured by Gross Geographic Product (adjusted for purchasing power), totalled US$84.7&nbsp;billion (US$34,200 per capita) in 2011&nbsp;and amounts to nearly a quarter of Argentina's as a whole.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The city can be divided into 15&nbsp;<em>comunas</em> which, in turn, can be further divided into &ldquo;barrios&rdquo;, reaching a total 48 official&nbsp;<em>barrios.</em>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The idea is to cluster the different neighbourhoods in Buenos Aires by the similarity of their venues, and then, apply a classification algorithm to see which category Alta Cordoba falls into. This will reduce the list of neighbourhoods where the restaurant can be located. Of course, more detailed analysis should be performed to find the best (or at least a good enough) location for the restaurant, but for the time being, this approach should considerably reduce the list of possible candidates.</p>
<h2><strong>Data description</strong></h2>
<p>Apart from the Foursquare location data that will be retrieved from the API to get the most common venues inside any given neighbourhood, we are going to need information about Buenos Aires, since for Cordoba we only need the information of a single neighbourhood (Alta Cordoba) which can easily be found using <strong>geocoders</strong>.</p>
<p>The dataset containing Buenos Aires neighbourhood was obtained from the public city dataset pool: <u><a href="https://data.buenosaires.gob.ar">https://data.buenosaires.gob.ar</a></u>. Here it is possible to obtain the the different barrios, comunas and, with a little bit of data cleaning, latitude and longitude values.</p>
